				<h3>"A Loving Wage"</h3>
				<p>I'm not a boss. Certainly not of my cats. But where does this fit with a "Wage", "Minimum Wage" and "A Living Wage"?</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<i>December 9th, 2017</i>					
				<h3>"An Interesting Microeconomics Dissertation?"</h3>
				<p>Can supply and demand be applied to labor? Pay the jobs with the least demand more. Pay the jobs with the most demand less. Could payroll be maintained? What, if any, changes would have to be made to the skill infrastructure?</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<i>December 9th, 2017</i>					
				<h3>"An Interesting Macroeconomics Dissertation?"</h3>
				<p>Study what is really being sold in advertisement. Does everyone get paid equitably? Does the consumer get what is advertised? Is this type of study neccesary for market prediction?</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<i>December 19th, 2017</i>					
				<h3>"Investment"</h3>
				<p>Buy on the rumor, sell on the news? Are there more paid economic forecasters than investors? Is insider trading just another part of the rumor?</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<i>December 19th, 2017</i>					
				<h3>"Who gets to set case-law precedence?"</h3>
				<p>We have legislation written by some much Legislature that it is unreadable except in piece-meal coordination with an Executive based institionalization machine. The machine runs until interupted by Judiciary after-the-fact case-law precedence. Anyone read The Dosadi Experiment by Frank Herbert?</p>

				<i>December 19th, 2017</i>					
				<h3>"What tri-chromatic color model to use."</h3>
				<p>click on HOWTO on left-hand menu and refer to associated section for my research.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<i>March 25th, 2018</i>					
				<h3>"Partial Induction."</h3>
				<p>Is this really inference at all? Two different approaches are divination and statistical empiricism.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<i>April 5th, 2018</i>					
				<h3>"Impermanence."</h3>
				<p>Would there be any exploration and discovery without impermanence? Does one ascend impermanence when all exploration and discovery are complete?</p>
				<br>
